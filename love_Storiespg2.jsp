  "The canister had always been there, rolling around at the bottom of his duffle bag. Whenever he packed, his fingers would graze over the smooth, gray top, but he’d never take it out, never look directly at it. Sometimes when he unpacked, the canister would get wound up in a dirty sock or wedged inside a pocket, and it would come up with a handful of laundry as he went to chuck it into the machine. Whenever this happened, Jake would carefully retrieve the black cylinder and tuck it back into the bottom corner of his bag. 

That’s where it belonged. That’s where it stayed. For years. 

It had been so long, he no longer remembered what was on the film, what pictures could be frozen there on the tiny strip of celluloid. 

When Maggie died, Jake was lost. He left his job, gave up their apartment, packed a few things into his duffle bag, and left town. He gave up on himself, letting his hair grow long and his beard grow white.

He drove the highways aimlessly, stoic behind the wheel of their beloved ‘69 Charger. Maggie loved that car more than most things and having her gone, looking to his right and seeing her seat empty was like a dagger to the side every time he looked. In the late afternoons, he could imagine her there; small hand hanging out of the window, fingers surfing on the wind. He could see the golden light of sunset in her fiery hair, illuminating her pale, beautiful face like an angel. If he wanted it badly enough, Jake could reach across the seats and take her hand, close his fingers around the apparition, feel her close. 

But when reality returned, it hit hard. 

His tears never seemed to stop, falling hard like a downpour on the windshield. The back of his hand wasn’t as efficient as the wipers to blast the drops of salty pain away, but it was all he had. When it was bad, he pulled over, caution lights blinking on the side of the road until the worst was over.  

Jake stuck to the smaller towns, enjoying the feel of an old-timey Main Street. He liked to see the houses built close together, their covered porches inviting neighbors and strangers alike to sit and talk. He loved the old mom and pop stores, their windows filled with enticing seasonal displays. He told the time by these windows, counting months with glittered paper shamrocks or tiny American flags. 

Mostly he floated. There was nowhere to be, no destination waiting for him at the end of the road. He slept in the car, stretching his long legs across the backseat and using her old gray hoodie as a pillow. Her smell had long ago faded, but if he tried hard enough, Jake could remember the faint hint of coconut that always seemed to spring from her skin. She liked to tease him saying that being from Florida meant that everything about her was tropical, even her scent. He didn’t care why she smelled like she did, what shampoo or lotion combination made her so delicious, he just knew that she was. 

Maggie had been the light of and in his life and now he wandered in the shadows without her. 

At night, with passing headlights rolling across the roof, Jake would conjure up a dream of her. It was routine now. He started with her hair, that flaming red mess of curls that tangled between his fingers, catching even when he tried to be smooth with his touches. Her eyes came next, faded denim blue beneath pale lashes that were almost blonde in the sunlight. They were his favorite; clear and true and filled with nothing but love when they lingered on his face. 

He’d fall asleep like that, imagining her features, recreating her in his mind. Some nights she would sneak into his dreams and he’d curl in on himself, loving the fantasy. Other times there was nothing behind his eyes, no comforting smile, no warm laugh, no touch from her delicate hand. 

Those nights were cold and sleep was far from his grasp. The worst part was, those nights were coming more often lately. It seemed harder for him to invoke her spirit, to remember the curve of her cheek, the pitch of her nose. 

Maggie was fading away. 

He worked odd jobs when he felt like it or when his wallet was empty and the gas tank was low. He was strong and tall, and construction work came easy to him, though there was no passion in it for him. It was just a day or two out in the sun, tanning his big arms and filling the car back up. A few bosses would ask him to stay on, but he never accepted. There were roads left to travel, stars yet to sleep beneath. He made a few friends along the way, but none would ever stick; it wasn’t worth the effort anyway. He knew he wasn’t good for anything without her, wasn’t someone anyone would want to know. He was just a traveler now, a ghost like her.

The desert was dry and sweat was beading on his chest and brow. He beat the drops away but they came right back, teasing him like some wicked dream. With the sun bright in the distance, he squinted at the road ahead and marveled at the steam coming up from the pavement. Heat lines danced before his eyes and the white lines blurred. His vision was glossy; his eyes were stinging. 

Reaching into the backseat, Jake dug into the duffle bag and fished around for a clean shirt. He needed something to wipe the day away, to clear his head once more before the mirage on the side of the road took over.

  "If you love someone, let them go.

My life is in pages—planners, books, graphs, charts. Paper reminds me of the world right before a storm, quiet and heavy with impending chaos, like knowing what will happen before you turn the page.

The delineating lines in my planner are a comfort, a reminder that I have a tomorrow, and a next week, and a next month. Every page is nearly the same, every day in existence because I made it so. I can’t die on Wednesday if I have to fold the laundry, right?

Curves are somehow less formulaic than the lines of my planner. Curves have no definite answer or guarantee. There are exceptions, however. The curvature of the fine print in the novels on my shelves flows in lines: left to right, top to bottom, every page the same. I like the longer ones, the ones that take me sleepless nights and endless days to finish, brimming with gory detail. It’s my imagination, but it’s laid out neatly in front of me–everything happens before I turn the page.

I wish my life were only made of those pages. I wish that numbers and their fickle unpredictability would leave me once and for all. I used to revel in them and the way they could make lines twist and jump. Graphs were artwork and books were boring; there was no adventure in the predetermined. I wish I still thought Icarus was a stupid name for a boy.

Now, the numbers that I loved so dearly tell me that I am going to die. I read about Icarus in the legends; what a valiant life he led.

According to my planner I have two days left, but my hands are too weak to hold a pen. I can feel the cancer in the depths of my mind, crippling my body and infecting everything I touch. My vision is shaded with sickness, and the smell of death lingers in our house. The reaper’s impending presence is crushing.

Still, each second must be written in ink. My hands have developed a tremor and my letters have grown shaky, but maybe, if I plan each breath, I can spend them all with you.

You were flying with me, hand in hand, too close to the sun. You whispered words I had never heard and painted colors I had never seen. I dragged you higher, higher, higher still, until the light was blinding and the heat was white against our skin. We didn’t care, because who was Icarus to us, anyway? I let you guide me, let my blind faith in the mystery of fate weave itself throughout my melting wings, and when it carried us higher, higher, higher still, I laughed into the wind.

It’s funny how faith is as fickle as numbers. My diagnosis pulled us to the depths of the ocean below, and I met your eyes as the water took us both. 

That was the day I knew that fate could not be trusted. I felt my body fold into yours, tears in my eyes and a deep uneasiness in my chest. I opened my mouth to scream, but nothing came out. The bright fluorescence of the hospital only accentuated the pain with all of its sharp angles and harsh features. I held onto your shirt, clinging to something I knew would soon be gone. I didn’t plan for this to happen–how could I? I didn’t even have a planner, back then. Now, I plan to never let you go.

Catching memories is like holding smoke, and still, every day, I wrote out when you’d hold me until I fell asleep. Your soft assurances did nothing when I felt my bones against my own skin as we swayed to Frank Sinatra in the living room. I slipped from your arms, faster than I ever thought possible. I know you saw it, too, but still, you brought me the planner every morning at eight.

Tears roll down my cheeks as I glance at it. It sits on my bedside table, untouched from earlier. I’m too sick to write, too sick to even reach for it. I want nothing more than to assure myself that I have another week with me, and another week with you. I have laundry to do on Wednesday, tomorrow, but I can’t even sit up in bed. You look over at me with those eyes, the same ones that fell with me to the ocean floor, but you leave the planner as it is and trace my face. I miss the days when your feathered touches made my breath hitch in the back of my throat–when they meant something other than sorrow.

It’s all I can do to blink away the tears. A desperate sense of hopelessness crawls through my chest–I should have planned a little farther ahead. My hands begin to shake as my breathing becomes labored; I have laundry to do tomorrow. I can’t die today.

“It’s okay,” you whisper, placing your hand over mine. You squeeze it gently before lifting it into your lap. “You’ve fought for long enough.” You lean in and press a kiss to my forehead, and somewhere in the back of my feverish haze, I realize that this is all I will have left of you. The ocean has swept me away, and I cannot control the current.

I glance back at the planner—my life is in its pages, but it is also in the pages of the books on my shelves, the numbers and graphs I grew to hate so much, and, most importantly, in you. 

I glance back at the planner, but I leave it behind to meet your eyes one last time. I could never have planned such a death, but oh, my darling, I could never have planned such a life. I will never soar as high, laugh as hard, or love as freely as I did with you. Your eyes are the same ones I met as we flew and as we fell, but if I can write out only one more thing in this life, it is that I will die hand in hand with you.

They say that if you love someone, you have to let them go… and I? I love you.

I think my planner will sit, gathering dust on that bedside table, for the rest of a very long time. There are still pages left, empty between my life and the back cover.

What a shame.
