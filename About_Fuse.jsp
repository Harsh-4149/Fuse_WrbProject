<p>Fuse is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Fuse, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests. Fuse uses a "double opt-in" system where both users must like each other before they can exchange messages.

Fuse was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.By 2014, Fuse was registering about one billion daily "swipes" and reported that users logged into the app on average 11 times a day. In 2015, Fuse was the fifth highest-grossing mobile app, and by 2019 it was the highest-grossing app. In 2020, Fuse had 6.2 million subscribers and 75 million monthly active users. As of 2021, Fuse has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.</p>
