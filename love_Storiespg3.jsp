  "I was going to kill a man tonight. 

That’s why I went to the party. It was an extravagant, black-tie affair thrown on a warm late summer evening at the end of July. Hosted by none other than Walter Adler, the richest man in town. Midnight was approaching, and with it, my deadline. I dressed the part, wearing a maroon dress with a corset torso and a slit up the thigh. My makeup was reminiscent of the famous women in 1950s era America. I was, as they say, dressed to kill. 

This particular estate had been blessed with a ballroom perfect for gatherings such as these. I was on the second floor of the galant mansion, leaning over the rail of a balcony overhanging a bar in the center of the house. I was at my perch, an elegant nighthawk waiting for my prey. I surveyed the scene when a beguiling young man leaning against the bar caught my eye.

He was an eyecatcher, that’s for sure. It wasn’t the extravagant, attention-seeking purple suit jacket unbuttoned on his chest that caught my eye, nor was it the loose black tie around his neck, the slicked back umber brown hair, or the toothpick used as a substitute for some form of nicotine between his teeth. It was the bloody knuckles, the immature carmine scar along his left arm, and the vague outline of a tattoo of a scorpion’s stinger barely visible along the back of his neckline.

That’s when I knew he was the one. He was described in his profile almost identically to how he appeared. His demeanor confirmed what we knew of his personality; that he was egomaniacal, vainglorious, but unfortunately charismatic and believes himself to be philanthropic. He was ingenious, devilishly handsome, and beyond intriguing. Surely only he could be the target I was assigned. It was such a shame I was going to have to kill him. 

There are plenty of ways to murder someone without any comprehension of observation on their part. In order to properly take the life of someone as smart as this particular gentleman, the key is to get him to notice the oddities engraved in your actions while providing enough of a distraction that he chalks it up to a beautiful dame’s unfortunate personality. This man was no halfwit, but he was young, attractive and vain. So, I deduced that an old fashioned plan of seduction would work out beautifully. For me, at least. 

I turned around and sauntered gallantly through the crowd of laughing and smiling wealthy people all pretending to have not a care in the world. If their lives were really that easy, I’d be out of a job. I demanded my presence to be conceded to subtly and silently as I smiled politely at those I walked past, muttering a few phrases of pardon along the way, all the while never taking my eyes off this mysterious charming stranger. I made my way down the mahogany staircase and along the edge of the room absolutely packed with dancers. I managed to spot the bar at the very end of the room, and strolled innocently towards it.

I sat in the barstool next to him, the curious stranger that had become my prey, and waited like a vampire in a doorway for just a few seconds before making direct eye contact. From this distance, he was even more of an engrossing sight. He had dark scruff resembling a goatee on his chin, perhaps a dozen small white scars along his hands, arms, and even one on his forehead, and he smelled vaguely of firewhiskey. Most of all, there was an impossible to miss look of a tormented wild beast hiding deep inside his eyes. 

After making it clear I was sizing him up, I gazed at his unbuttoned jacket and smiled. He started to look me up and down in response before smiling softly and shifting his body to face me while still charismatically leaning against the bar. He thought he was at the advantage point, little did he know he was walking right into my trap. He was playing along beautifully yet stupidly all at once. I had no time to waste. I reached out towards him, offering my hand while gazing playfully up into his tortured eyes. I asked delicately, “Care to dance?”

He grinned while grabbing my hand and slipping me off of the stool, “What’s the name, toots?”

I stepped closer to him so we were breathing the same air. I became acutely aware of the fact that he was at least five inches taller than I was. “Does it matter what my name is, as long as we both have a good time?”

He chuckled and grabbed me by the waist while leading me out onto the dance floor. “Fair enough, princess.” 

I was guided by the small of my back to the center of the dance floor as a romantic song began to play. This unfortunate target of mine was a phenomenal dancer, pulling me close then pushing me away, spinning me around and then even going so far as to dip me downwards as he gazed into my eyes in a tease. Then, he’d stand me on my feet and dance with me normally as if he hadn’t just nearly, almost, kissed me. Coming close but not close enough. Worst of all, he had made me want it. Which was a curse so unforgivable I could hardly stand it. 

Dancing with him felt like heaven, which distracted me more than I’d ever like to admit. I wanted him, when he was the last thing I should be wanting. I was on a mission. I don’t feel things, I’ve never felt things, and I wasn’t going to start now. But with him I was a spider lily, blossoming in the moonlight. If only I had any clue what was really blooming that night. Perhaps I would’ve done things differently. If that were the case, maybe I wouldn’t be dead.

He spun me around, gracefully twirling me through a doorway into an empty library away from the noise of the party. A nice, secluded area where no one could see us. 

We stopped our dance and he smiled. “You’re a good dancer.”

I beamed and glanced up at him, “You’re not bad yourself.” I put a hand on his chest, bit my lip teasingly as I stared into his dark, menacing eyes, “Would you like to go get some air?”

He chuckled in response, and I pulled back away from him. Laughter was not the correct reaction. He was straying from my plan. With a smirk, he replied, “How forward of you, babydoll. We’ve truly been having such a delightful time, I regret to inform you I’m going to have to kill you.” He pulled me closer again by the waist, refusing to let me escape. 

I furrowed my brows and scowled. The audacity, who does this insolent sorry excuse of an enemy mafia’s champion think he is?! It was my job to kill him, not the other way around. I was going to damn well make sure he knew that. I grabbed him by the tie and pulled downward, forcing him to drop to my eye level. “Watch it, teddy bear. I saw my target first, and I never miss.”

“Bold of you to assume you didn’t catch my eye as soon as you walked into the room.” He squeezed my waist, spun me around and pulled me backwards so my back was flush against him, and whispered in my ear from over my shoulder, “Your organization is corrupt. You won’t see us coming, the Scorpions will strike to kill before you can blink. You’re just one of many targets, darling. Don’t flatter yourself by thinking you’re anything special.”

His failed attempt at hurting my ego was adorable. I spun back around to face him and wrapped my hands together behind his neck. “You assume I’m one of them.”

“You’re either one of them or they started hiring harlots to do their dirty work.”

I rolled my eyes and scoffed, but he wasn’t wrong; he simply saw through my plan. I grabbed his waist, taking my turn to pull him close and whisper in his ear, “You’re handsome, but I’m afraid that’s where the charm ends, dear. I’ll be the one doing the killing tonight.” With that, I unsheathed my dagger through the slit in my dress and held it up to his throat. 

I tried to slit it, but he held his arm up just in time and was barely preventing me from doing so. He used his legs to kick me in the stomach and I kneeled over, allowing him to grab the dagger and pin me against the wall from behind.

“You’re enamoring, glamorous, and clever. I’ll give you that. What you lack is the ability to anticipate someone just as enticing, charming, and intelligent as you working for the other side.”

I found his accusations laughable. With a chuckle and condescending smile, I retorted, “Once again you’re full of assumptions. I’m harder to read than you think. Also, how bold of you to think even for a moment we’re anything alike. You’ll never be as good as me. After all, I would’ve killed you by now if I was in your position.”

  <h5><strong>Choices</strong></h5>
  </p>

  "Locals say it's a magnet for drifters but he just calls it home. It’s known as Tornado Alley, but most folks don’t go there to bowl; they go there to drink and forget. The foundation is original, but the building is not; it’s been rebuilt twice, once in 2009 and again in 2014. 

His small apartment sits just behind the office and has everything a single man needs. It has a comfortable chair positioned right beside a twin bed and in front of a flat screen TV. He has a refrigerator that sometimes has food, but always has beer. There are no pictures on the walls, only a calendar and clock. Silent reminders that time and days actually do pass. At closing he cleans the mess from the drunks he never kicks out, restocks the bar and retreats to his sanctuary to wait to do the same thing the next day. He is alone. He is always alone.

In Moore, Oklahoma, everyone knows the sound. It’s high pitched, it’s loud and it’s continuous. Most folks hear it and rush for the cellar—but not him, not tonight. He’s been destroyed and rebuilt, twice. It’s his business and his life and he’s not going to do it again. If fate chooses him tonight he will go willingly. Tonight he is Ahab. Tonight he is Leonidas. Tonight he’s a bowling alley owner at his breaking point. As the siren sounds he pulls the rag, ever present, from his back pocket and cleans the bar just as he always does at closing time.

The door bursts open and he sees her standing against the quickly blackening background. She is windblown and panicked. Her hair ruffled and unkempt. She isn’t pretty now but he’s sure most Friday nights she’s manicured and attractive. She’s dressed in a skirt and high heels. Even tonight she doesn’t fit in. She scans the room but finds no one but him. Her face contorts in fear. If she’s looking for safety, it's nowhere to be found. There is nowhere to hide, no protection from what is coming.

A mind plays out all the scenarios in the space of seconds but in a moment she changes everything. He is willing to let destiny decide his fate tonight but that is his choice, not hers. Why is he responsible for her? He doesn’t know but he is. The storm cellar is no longer an option—it’s too far. There isn’t enough time. There is never enough time. 

There had been women before, but in this moment there is only her. In this moment he is no longer Ahab or Leonidas; he is a father or a brother or a husband.

His instincts take over as he motions her to follow him. Without hesitation she complies. No words are spoken as he leads her to the room behind the office. It doesn’t offer safety but it does offer companionship. They will not face this trial alone. He leads her to the chair beside the bed in front of the TV and he coaxes her to sit down next to him. He knows she shouldn’t do it, she doesn’t know him. None of that matters, she follows his directions without question.

In the chair he places his arm around her. He’s not sure why, he just thinks he should. In the chair she leans against his chest as if she is listening for his heartbeat. The only sound is the siren until it comes. 

A tornado is wind, only it’s not. It’s death. It’s a freight train. It’s the sight of things flying that don’t fly and the sound of things colliding that shouldn’t collide. In the chair and without words they feel the rumbling of the building, they hear the destruction that surrounds them. He is painfully aware of his vulnerability and the consequence of his choice. He is aware his choice now involves her. He pulls a stranger close because a stranger is all he has. He is powerless, which is terrifying yet strangely beautiful. In an inexplicable way he understands what it is to share only one thing with another human being. No past, no future, just a moment.

And then it’s gone. Death came for a visit but didn't stay. The siren is silent, the wind has subsided and the danger has passed. The two strangers, as if waking from a dream, realize they are in a life-saving embrace on a comfortable chair in front of a flat screen TV next to a twin bed. A few frightening minutes—that felt like years—are over and real life has returned, only it hasn’t.

She gathers herself and stands. He does the same. She fixes her hair as best she can and he puts his rag in his back pocket. She turns to him as if to say something, anything, but there is nothing to say. After a pause, almost longer than the trauma, she takes his face in her hands and kisses him.

In his life he will never have another kiss like that one. Soft yet strong. Thankful and passionate. Intimate yet anonymous. She turns to leave, he wants her to stay. He wants her to but he knows she won’t. He wants the moment to last, but like a tornado, a moment like this is here and then it’s gone and there is no way to stop it. He watches her walk out the same door she entered just a few minutes earlier and his mind fills with questions. 

Is it possible to meet the love of your life without words? Is it possible to see her just once and have her fill your heart forever? Is it possible to face death and find life? Is it possible she might feel the same? 

He will never know the answers to those questions, but he knows the bar won’t clean itself so he pulls the rag from his back pocket and starts to wipe. Everything is back to normal but nothing will ever be the same.
