<h3>Community Guidelines</h3>
  <p>
  <h6>    Welcome to the Fuse community. If you’re honest, kind and respectful to others, you’ll always be welcome here. If you choose not to be, you may not last. Our goal is to allow users to express themselves freely as long as it doesn’t offend others. Everyone is held to the same standard on Fuse. We’re asking you to be considerate, think before you act, and abide by our community guidelines both on and offline. You heard that right: your offline behavior can lead to termination of your Fuse account.

Below is a list of our community policies. If you violate any of these policies, you might be banned from Fuse. Seriously, don’t make us Swipe Left on you—because there will be no do-overs once we do.

Content that advocates for or glorifies suicide or self-harm is also not allowed. In these situations, we may take a number of steps to assist the user, including reaching out with crisis resources."

While we’re excited that you’re doing a comedy show next week, please don’t use Fuse to promote it."
